# TasmotaThing

A self-hosted web service to locally and remotely control your Tasmota devices.

### Installation

TasmotaHome relies on three libraries:

1. requests-html
2. requests
3. flask

All three can be acquired with pip.

Afterward, download the folder and execute TasmotaHome.py. In a web browser, navigate to localhost:5000.

You will be presented by the main screen, which is a group overview of the Tasmota-powered IOT devices you have connected.
